        >>> CI/CD is really cool, but sometimes it's unnecessary....
        >>> Sometimes all you need is that Manual Docker-compose flow.

# Sometimes you want to buld the image locally and push it to docker hub then run it in your server: 
         >>> You can use my docker-compose.yml to build and push
         >>> You can also use this to pull, run & pass env variables in your server once image is pushed
